Then you should definitely check out this immersive VR game 'Whack-A-Mole'. You can play with your family, friends and even with the computer. The game is multi-platform and it supports Andriod, IOS. The most fascinating thing about Whack-A-Mole is, you can get a real-world value for the stuff you win. That's because Whack-a-Mole game runs on a Blockchain network.

Blockchain Technology is revolutionizing the gaming industry. Most of the games that we play are controlled by centralized agencies. Blockchain creates transparency and solves this multifaceted problem by eliminating centralized gaming entities. In-game payment mechanisms and good control over NFTs have made gaming more powerful and engaging. That is why we made our game compatible with the ERC 721 architecture and we also built a real-world market place for the stuff you win. We also integrated Tezos Blockchain based payments for both ingame and market place transactions.
